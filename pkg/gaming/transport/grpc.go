// The host, over gRPC and mutual TLS.

// forwarding, and no address the host has to be told - which is what lets it
// run on a laptop behind NAT against a bridge on somebody's appliance.
//
// It never states which game it is. The certificate it presents is its
// identity, and the bridge resolves that: everything the bridge enforces -
// which game a frame may be sent as, which account may be spent from, under
// what caps - hangs off what the certificate resolves to. The credential is
// carried here by hand once and lives on this machine; nothing fetches it.
