// Package transport carries game protocol frames over Bison Relay group chats.
//
// It is the join between framing and a table. Inbound, it recognises frames,
// decides whether the sender is allowed to be talking to this table at all,
// reassembles them and hands up decoded messages. Outbound, it splits a message
// into frames and sends them.
//
// What it does not do is as important. A Bison Relay group message is fanned
// out by its sender as separate one-to-one messages, so there is no shared
// stream, no ordering and no guarantee two members received the same thing.
// This layer therefore never implies any of that: it reports what arrived and
// who sent it. Sequencing and agreement live in pkg/gamelog, which signs and
// chains entries precisely because arrival order cannot be trusted.
//
// Authorization is injected rather than decided here, and the distinction it
// must draw is the whole reason. Membership of the group chat is administered
// by one member, is never attested, can differ between members at the same
// generation, and changes merely by receiving a message. It cannot be what
// decides who may spend a table's memory or be believed about its history. The
// caller supplies a predicate backed by the escrow roster - the one membership
// list everyone whose money is at stake has agreed to on-chain.
