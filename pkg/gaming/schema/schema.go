// Package schema is what a table says to itself, independent of how it is
// carried.
//
// The messages here are the game's own vocabulary. They travel inside
// --gaming[…]-- frames over Bison Relay, and today the same information also
// moves over gRPC; neither transport is part of their definition. That is the
// point. The gRPC surface is transitional, so anything defined in terms of it
// would have to be defined again later, and a signature over a payload would
// have to be recomputed rather than carried.
//
// Two rules run through all of it.
//
// Identity is never a field. The sender's Bison Relay uid is the authenticated
// identity, and a payload claiming one could only ever be a way to lie about
// it. Where a message needs to say which seat acted, it carries a signature
// that proves it rather than a name that asserts it.
//
// Seat, action, amount, signature and chain head are payload, never envelope.
// If a router or a content filter ever needed to understand a fold in order to
// move it, the separation would already have failed.

// Version is the game protocol version, carried as gv in the envelope and
// separate from the framing version.
//
// The dealing frames - card key, shuffle, leaving - must carry the signature of
// the seat they name, and a peer refuses one without it. There is deliberately no
// mode that accepts unsigned frames, because such a mode is the hole itself, held
// open by a flag somebody forgets. Peers on different versions therefore do not
// play together, which is the intended behaviour rather than something to work
// around.
//
// 3 changes the table bond: a claim no longer takes it but moves it into a claimed
// bond, where its owner has a window to answer with its own key. The bond script
// loses its claim branch, so its address changes, and a bond posted under an
// earlier version is a bond under earlier rules.
//
// 4 adds audit on challenge: any seat may demand a settled hand be recomputed
// from every seat's deck secrets, and refusing to reveal is answered by the
// claim. A peer on 3 cannot be asked to reveal, so the two do not play together.
//
// 5 adds the card-key possession proof and the shuffle dispute. A card key now
// carries a Schnorr proof that its announcer knows its discrete log, folded
// into the signed digest - a key without one is refused, so 4 and 5 do not
// play together. And a signed shuffle that fails verification can be disputed
// with a complaint that carries everything a verdict needs; every peer judges
// it identically, the hand is void, and the table settles at the last signed
// boundary without unanimity.
