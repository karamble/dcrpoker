// have not seen it - so there is nothing to settle it by, and it is simply void.

// same transaction whoever broadcasts it, so there is no accusation to make and

// Claim proposes taking a bond from a seat that is holding the table up, for the

// stalls could wait for their opponent to give up and then claim the bond of the
// person who stopped playing because of them. Heads-up there is nobody else to
// refuse it.

// that against its own copy before signing (driver.Table.Agrees). A seat that
// owes nothing cannot be claimed against, which is exactly the case a staller
// needs: while they are the one holding things up, it is their turn, so the
// player waiting on them owes nothing.
