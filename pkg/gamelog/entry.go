// Package gamelog is the signed, hash-chained record of what happened at a
// poker table.
//
// Today one server runs the game and keeps the only account of it, so a hand's
// history is exactly as trustworthy as the server: it can be rewritten, and a
// fold nobody made can be invented, with nothing a third party could check.
// This package makes the history stand on its own. Each action is signed by the
// seat that took it and chained to the one before, so a transcript can be
// handed to anyone and verified offline.
//
// It matters more once players talk to each other directly. Bison Relay
// groupchat messages are fanned out by the sender as separate one-to-one
// messages, with no relay point, no shared transcript and no sequence numbers -
// so a member can tell one player they folded and another that they raised, and
// the network will never notice. A chain of signed entries is what gives such a
// table a single well-defined history at all, and what turns equivocation from
// an accusation into a two-message proof anyone can check.
//
// The package deliberately imports nothing from the gRPC layer. It has to
// outlive that transport, and the same bytes have to verify identically on
// every implementation, so its encoding is its own.
