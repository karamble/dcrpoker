// Checkpoint is what the stacks were when a hand ended, signed by one seat.
//
// It is the last thing everybody agreed on, and that is its whole job. A hand in
// progress is not agreed - one player is mid-decision and the other has not seen
// it - so there is nothing to settle it by. A hand boundary is different: the
// chips have moved, the pot is pushed, and every seat can sign the same numbers.
//
// That makes a checkpoint the only safe thing to settle on when a table stops
// unexpectedly. Money moves to where the last mutually-signed checkpoint says it
// was, and the hand that was under way is void - which is also why nobody has to
// work out who walked off. The answer does not depend on it.
//
// Signed under its own domain and indexed by hand rather than by sequence
// number. Both matter: without the domain, a checkpoint at hand 5 and an entry
// at sequence 5 would share a nonce and a seat would publish its own key by
// playing correctly.
