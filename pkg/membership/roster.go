// Package membership holds who is in one match: which session key sits in
// which seat, and the deposit scripts that membership commits to.
//
// It lives outside the server because the server is on its way out. A table
// formed peer to peer has no referee to ask, so every player has to derive the
// same seats and the same deposit scripts from the same keys - and the moment
// two implementations of that exist, they can disagree by a byte and send money
// somewhere nobody can spend it. This is the same reasoning that put the script
// construction in pkg/escrow, applied one layer up: the membership a script
// commits to is as load-bearing as the script.
//
// Nothing here knows about poker. Seats, stakes and rosters are the lobby, and
// the lobby is game-agnostic; cards are somebody else's problem.
