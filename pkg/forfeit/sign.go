// Package forfeit makes cheating cost money.
//
// pkg/gamelog can already prove that a seat equivocated - told one player it
// folded and another that it raised - and the proof verifies offline, forever,
// without a quorum. Nothing can act on it. The escrow has an n-of-n settlement
// branch and a unilateral refund branch, and neither is conditioned on fraud,
// so a player who equivocates and then stops signing forces everybody to the
// CSV refund and loses the fees. Provable and unpunishable.
//
// It cannot be fixed by putting the proof in a script. Decred script verifies
// signatures over the spending transaction and nothing else; it cannot parse a
// log, compare two entries, or evaluate a claim. Any design that needs a script
// to *judge* something is dead on arrival, and any design that needs a quorum
// of players to judge it instead has handed n-1 colluding players the power to
// convict the one honest one.
//
// So the cheat is made to publish the key itself.
//
// A Schnorr signature is s = k - e*d, where k is a per-signature nonce. Derive
// k from the signing key and the *position in the log* - and deliberately not
// from the message - and one signature per position reveals nothing, while two
// signatures at one position share k and give
//
//	s1 - s2 = (e2 - e1)*d
//
// which anybody can solve for d. Equivocation is exactly signing twice at one
// position. The cheat does not get reported, judged or voted on: it hands its
// key to everyone who saw both messages.
//
// The bond's punishment branch then pays to a key only a wronged player can
// assemble, and the script does nothing cleverer than check a signature. See
// escrow.ForfeitableBondScript.
//
// # What this key must not be
//
// The leaked key is a per-match key that signs log entries and nothing else. It
// is emphatically *not* the session key: that one is named in the escrow script
// and holds the player's stake, so leaking it would let any passing observer
// take the stake rather than letting the wronged player take the bond. The
// penalty has to be bounded and it has to be directed. A log key is bound to a
// session key by signature, so the roster knows whose it is, and forfeiting it
// costs exactly one bond.
